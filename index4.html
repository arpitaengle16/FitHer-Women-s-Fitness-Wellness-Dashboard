                <ul>
                  
                    <h2> Focus on Core Engagement</h2>
                    <li>The foundation of Pilates is the core (or "Powerhouse"), which includes your abs, lower back, hips, and pelvic floor.</li>
                    <li>Engage your deep core muscles by pulling your belly button towards your spine during exercises.</li> 

                    <h2>Prioritize Proper Breathing</h2>
                    <li>Use lateral breathing—inhale through the nose, expanding the ribcage, and exhale through the mouth, drawing the core in.</li>
                    <li>Proper breathing improves oxygen flow, prevents tension, and supports movement control.</li>
                    

                    <h2>Maintain Good Posture</h2>
                    <li>Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears.</li>
                    <li>Align your spine and avoid overarching or slouching.</li>
                    <li>Lengthen your neck to prevent strain.</li>

                    <h2>Strengthen the Pelvic Floor</h2>
                    <li>Kegel exercises can be incorporated into Pilates to support bladder control and core strength.</li>
                    <li>Pelvic tilts and bridges help activate and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.</li>

                    <h2>Modify During Pregnancy or Postpartum</h2>
                    <li>Avoid exercises that put pressure on the abdomen, such as crunches or roll-ups.</li>
                    <li>Focus on gentle core activation and stability exercises like pelvic tilts and side-lying leg work.</li>

                    <h2>Use Control & Precision </h2>
                    <li>Unlike high-impact workouts, Pilates is about controlled, precise movements rather than speed or intensity.</li>
                    <li>Focus on quality over quantity—10 well-executed reps are more effective than 50 rushed ones.</li>

                    <h2>Don't Skip Stretching</h2>
                    <li> Pilates helps build flexibility as well as strength—incorporate stretches like the Mermaid Stretch and Spinal Twist to prevent stiffness.</li>
                    
                    <h2> Strengthen the Back & Prevent Pain</h2>
                    <li>If you have back pain, avoid excessive forward flexion (e.g., full sit-ups) and focus on neutral spine alignment.</li>
                    <li>Exercises like Swan Dive and Swimming strengthen the lower back and improve posture.</li>

                    <h2>Stay Consistent</h2>
                    <li>Aim for at least 2-4 sessions per week for best results.</li>
                    <li>Even a 10-20 minute daily routine can improve strength, mobility, and posture.</li>

                    <h2>Use Props for Better Support</h2>
                    <li>Resistance bands and Pilates rings add extra challenge to workouts.</li>
                    <li>Small exercise balls help engage stabilizing muscles, especially for core and pelvic floor work.</li>
