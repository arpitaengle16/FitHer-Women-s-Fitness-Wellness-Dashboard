                    <h2>Focus on Compound Exercises</h2>
                    <li>Why? They engage multiple muscle groups, leading to better strength gains and calorie burn.</li>
                    <li>Best Exercises: Squats, deadlifts, lunges, push-ups, pull-ups, bench presses, and rows.</li>

                    <h2> Start with Proper Form</h2>
                    <li> Learn the correct technique before increasing weights.</li>
                    <li>Use mirrors or record yourself to check form. </li>
                    <li> Consider working with a trainer for guidance.</li>

                    <h2>Progressive Overload is Key</h2>
                    <li>Gradually increase weights, reps, or intensity over time.</li>
                    <li> Aim to challenge muscles without sacrificing form.</li>

                    <h2>Don’t Be Afraid of Heavy Weights</h2>
                    <li>Lifting heavy won’t make you bulky—it will make you stronger and leaner.</li>
                    <li>Strength training boosts metabolism and promotes fat loss.</li>

                    <h2>Balance Strength & Recovery</h2>
                    <li>Train each muscle group 2-3 times per week for best results. </li>
                    <li> Include rest days for muscle recovery and growth.</li>
                    <li>Prioritize sleep (7-9 hours) and hydration.</li>

                    <h2> Nutrition Supports Strength</h2>
                    <li>Protein is key—consume lean protein sources (chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, beans).</li>
                    <li>Carbs fuel workouts, so include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.</li>
                    <li> Stay hydrated to support muscle recovery and performance.</li>

                    <h2>Core & Stability Matter</h2>
                    <li> A strong core improves posture, balance, and overall strength.</li>
                    <li> Add exercises like planks, dead bugs, and Russian twists.</li>
