                  <h1>Menstrual Cycle</h1>

                  <p>The menstrual cycle is a natural, recurring process in women of reproductive age that prepares the body for pregnancy. It is regulated by hormones and typically lasts about 28 days, though it can range from 21 to 35 days in adults. The cycle consists of four main phases:</p>
                  <img src=".vscode/pain.jpg"alt="Womens-Wellness">
                  <h2> Menstrual Phase (Days 1–5)</h2>
                  <li>The shedding of the uterine lining (endometrium) occurs if pregnancy does not happen.</li>
                  <li>Blood and tissue are expelled from the uterus through the vagina.</li>
                  <li>Hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) are low.</li>

                  <h2>Follicular Phase (Days 1–13)</h2>
                  <li>Overlaps with menstruation and extends until ovulation.</li>
                  <li>The pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), stimulating the growth of ovarian follicles.</li>
                  <li>Each follicle contains an egg, and one dominant follicle continues to mature.</li>
                  <li>Estrogen levels rise, helping rebuild the uterine lining.</li>

                  <h2>Ovulation (Around Day 14)</h2>
                  <li>A mature egg is released from the ovary due to a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH).</li>
                  <li>The egg travels through the fallopian tube and can be fertilized within 12–24 hours.</li>
                  <li>This is the most fertile period in the cycle.</li>

                  <h2>Luteal Phase (Days 15–28)</h2>
                  <li>After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone to maintain the uterine lining.</li>
                  <li>If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum breaks down, causing progesterone levels to drop.</li>
                  <li>This signals the uterus to shed its lining, leading to menstruation, and the cycle restarts.</li>

                  <h2>Hormonal Changes</h2>
                  <li>Estrogen: Peaks before ovulation and helps rebuild the uterine lining.</li>
                  <li>Progesterone: Rises after ovulation to support potential pregnancy.</li>
                  <li>LH & FSH: Regulate ovulation and follicle development.</li>

                  <h2>Common Menstrual Symptoms</h2>
                  <li>Cramps (dysmenorrhea)</li>
                  <li>Mood swings (PMS)</li>
                  <li>Bloating</li>
                  <li>Breast tenderness</li>
                  <li>Fatigue</li>

                  <p>Several menstrual disorders can affect a woman's menstrual cycle, leading to irregularities, pain, or other health concerns. Here are some common menstrual-related diseases and conditions:</p>
                  <h2>Dysmenorrhea (Painful Periods)</h2>
                  <li>Characterized by severe menstrual cramps.</li>
                  <li>Primary dysmenorrhea: No underlying medical condition, caused by prostaglandins (hormones that trigger uterine contractions).</li>
                  <li>Secondary dysmenorrhea: Caused by conditions like endometriosis or fibroids.</li>
                  
                  <h2> Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation)</h2>
                  <li>Primary amenorrhea: No menstruation by age 15.</li>
                  <li>Secondary amenorrhea: Periods stop for three months or more in someone with a previously normal cycle.</li>
                  <li>Causes: PCOS, excessive exercise, stress, eating disorders, thyroid disorders, or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).</li>
                  
                  <h2>Oligomenorrhea (Infrequent Periods)</h2>
                  <li>Menstrual cycles longer than 35 days or fewer than six to eight periods per year.</li>
                  <li>Causes: PCOS, thyroid dysfunction, high stress levels, or excessive weight loss/gain.</li>
                  

                  <h2>Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding)</h2>
                  <li>Prolonged or excessive menstrual bleeding.</li>
                  <li>Causes: Hormonal imbalances, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, or bleeding disorders.</li>

                  <h2>Endometriosis</h2>
                  <li>A condition where endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus, leading to pain and irregular bleeding.</li>
                  <li>Symptoms: Painful periods, pain during intercourse, chronic pelvic pain, infertility.</li>

                  <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
                  <li>Missed periods for 3+ months (not due to pregnancy).</li>
                  <li>Heavy bleeding requiring frequent pad/tampon changes.</li>
                  <li>Severe cramps unrelieved by pain medications.</li>
                  <li>Unexplained weight loss/gain or hair growth.</li>
                  <li>Symptoms of hormonal imbalance (acne, hair loss, fatigue).</li>

            <h1>Hormonal Imbalance in Women</h1>
            
            <p>Hormonal imbalance occurs when there is too much or too little of a hormone in the body, affecting various functions, including the menstrual cycle, metabolism, mood, and fertility.</p>
              <img src=".vscode/-imbalance-women.webp">
            <h2>Common Causes of Hormonal Imbalance in Women</h2>
            <li>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) – High androgens disrupt ovulation, causing irregular periods.</li>
            <li> Thyroid Disorders – Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormones) and hyperthyroidism (excess thyroid hormones) impact metabolism and menstruation.</li>
            <li>Chronic Stress – Increases cortisol levels, disrupting estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones.</li>
            <li>Menopause & Perimenopause – Estrogen and progesterone levels fluctuate, causing symptoms like hot flashes and irregular periods.</li>
            <li>Birth Control & Medications – Hormonal contraceptives can alter natural hormone production.</li>
            <li> Obesity & Poor Diet – Excess weight can increase estrogen levels, affecting menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li>Excessive Exercise & Eating Disorders – Low body fat and stress from over-exercising can lead to hormone disruption.</li>
            <li> Diabetes & Insulin Resistance – High insulin levels can contribute to PCOS and weight gain.</li>

            <h2> Symptoms of Hormonal Imbalance</h2>
            <li> Menstrual Irregularities – Missed, heavy, or infrequent periods.</li>
            <li>Weight Gain or Difficulty Losing Weight – Especially in PCOS and thyroid disorders.</li>
            <li>Fatigue & Low Energy – Often linked to low thyroid hormones or adrenal dysfunction.</li>
            <li>Acne & Oily Skin – Due to high androgens, common in PCOS.</li>
            <li>Hair Thinning or Excess Hair Growth (Hirsutism) – Caused by androgen imbalances.</li>
            <li>Mood Swings, Anxiety & Depression – Estrogen and progesterone impact serotonin and brain function.</li>
            <li> Sleep Issues & Insomnia – Low progesterone can cause difficulty sleeping.</li>
            <li>Low Libido & Vaginal Dryness – Due to low estrogen or testosterone.</li>
            <li>Hot Flashes & Night Sweats – Common during menopause and perimenopause.</li>
            
            <h2>Diagnosis of Hormonal Imbalance</h2>
            <li> Blood Tests – Measure hormone levels like estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, thyroid hormones, and insulin.</li>
            <li> Pelvic Ultrasound – Checks for ovarian cysts (PCOS) or fibroids.</li>
            <li>Saliva & Urine Hormone Tests – Sometimes used for adrenal and sex hormones.</li>

            <h2> What is PCOD?</h2>
            <img src=".vscode/pcod-symptomps.webp"alt="Womens-Wellness">
            <li>PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) is a condition where the ovaries produce immature or partially mature eggs, leading to cyst formation.</li>
            <li> It is caused by poor lifestyle, obesity, stress, and hormonal imbalances.</li>
            <li>It is less severe than PCOS and can often be managed with diet and exercise</li>

            <h3>Symptoms of PCOD:</h3>
            <li> Irregular Periods – Late or missed cycles.</li>
            <li> Mild Weight Gain – Often related to poor metabolism.</li>
            <li>Acne & Oily Skin – Due to increased androgens.</li>
            <li>Mild Hair Fall – But not as severe as in PCOS.</li>
            <li>Infertility Issues – But women with PCOD can conceive naturally.</li>

            <h3>Treatment for PCOD:</h3>
            <li>Lifestyle changes (healthy diet, exercise).</li>
            <li> Weight management.</li>
            <li>Reducing stress.</li>

            <h2>What is PCOS?</h2>
            <img src=".vscode/pcos.jpg"alt="Womens-Wellness">
            <li> PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder affecting metabolism and reproductive health.</li>
            <li>It is more severe than PCOD and linked to high androgen levels, insulin resistance, and inflammation.</li>
            <li>PCOS can cause serious health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and infertility if not managed properly.</li>

             <h3> Irregular or Absent Periods – Due to anovulation (lack of ovulation).</h3>
             <li>Weight Gain & Obesity – Especially around the abdomen</li>
             <li>Excessive Hair Growth (Hirsutism) – On the face, chest, or back.</li>
             <li>Severe Hair Loss (Female Pattern Baldness) – Due to high testosterone.</li>
             <li> Acne & Dark Skin Patches (Acanthosis Nigricans) – Due to insulin resistance.</li>
             <li>Difficulty in Getting Pregnant – PCOS is a leading cause of infertility.</li>
             <h3>Treatment for PCOS:</h3>
             <li>Diet & Lifestyle Changes – Low-carb, high-fiber diet, regular exercise.</li>
             <li>Medications – Birth control pills, Metformin (for insulin resistance), anti-androgens</li>
             <li>Hormonal Therapy – To regulate cycles and ovulation.</li>
             <li>Fertility Treatments – If conception is difficult.</li>
             <h3>Can PCOD or PCOS Be Cured?</h3>
             <li> No permanent cure, but both conditions can be managed effectively with:</li>
             <li>Healthy diet (low sugar, low processed foods, high protein & fiber)</li>
             <li>Regular exercise (walking, strength training, yoga)</li>
             <li>Weight loss (even 5-10% reduction helps regulate periods)</li>
             <li>Medical treatments (if necessary)</li>

             <h3>When to See a Doctor?</h3>
             <li> Irregular or missing periods for months</li>
             <li>Excessive facial hair, acne, or hair loss</li>
             <li>Difficulty in conceiving</li>
             <li> Unexplained weight gain or insulin resistance</li>
