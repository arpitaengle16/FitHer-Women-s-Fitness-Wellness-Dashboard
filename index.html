            <div class="grid-container">
                
             <div>
                <ul>
                  
                    <h2>Choose the Right Cardio Workout</h2>
                    <li>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): Short bursts of intense exercise followed by rest (e.g., sprinting, jumping jacks). Great for fat loss and endurance.</li>
                    <li> Steady-State Cardio: Activities like walking, jogging, or cycling at a moderate pace for longer durations to improve heart health.</li>
                    <li>Low-Impact Cardio: Swimming, rowing, or elliptical training is ideal if you have joint concerns.</li>
                    <h2>Make It Fun and Sustainable</h2>
                    <li>Try dance workouts (Zumba, hip-hop fitness)</li>
                    <li>Outdoor activities like hiking or cycling keep things fresh</li>
                    <li>Mix strength training with cardio (e.g., kettlebell swings)</li>
                    <h2>Optimize Your Cardio Routine</h2>
                    <li>Aim for 150–300 minutes of moderate or 75–150 minutes of intense cardio per week (as per WHO guidelines).</li>
                    <li> Incorporate variety to avoid plateaus and overuse injuries.</li>
                    <li>Use heart rate zones (e.g., 60–70% of max HR for fat burn, 70–85% for endurance).</li>
                    <h2> Support Your Cardio with Proper Nutrition</h2>
                    <li>Eat balanced meals with protein, carbs, and healthy fats for energy.</li>
                    <li>Stay hydrated to avoid cramps and fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Consider a pre-workout snack (banana + nut butter) and post-workout protein (Greek yogurt, smoothie).</li>
                    <h2> Listen to Your Body</h2>
                    <li>Avoid overtraining—rest days are essential for muscle recovery.</li>
                    <li>Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep to enhance endurance.</li>
                    <li> If you feel pain, stop and adjust your routine.</li>
                </ul>
